Loop-breaking cells for combinational feedback

The design contains loop-breaking cells that were inserted automatically to     
eliminate combinational feedback.  Since timing paths have been arbitrarily     
broken, timing results for this design should not be trusted.  The              
loop-breaking cells are:
